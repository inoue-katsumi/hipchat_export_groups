# hipchat_export_groups

Python script to export Hipchat group messages. \
Originally from https://github.com/amikeal/hipchat_export \
It started as very minimal change as I wrote in my blog at \
https://katsumiinoue.wordpress.com/2018/11/08/hipchat-export-python-script/

## Usage:

```bash
$ hipchat-exp-room.py --user_token {your token} -x ${roomid}
```

## hipchat-exp-room.py:

1. Please change hipchat URL. It's hard-coded. \
2. Please change time range parameter inside.
